# Overview
After we understood what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. Itâ€™s time to perform this challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their features. In order to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

# Results

There are a total of 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.

- I used unsupervised machine learning to identify clusters of cryptocurrencies. for this reason, I produced the elbow curve using the K-Means method iterating on k values from 1 to 10. The best k value appears to be 4 so we would conclude on an output of 4 clusters to categorize the cryptocurrencies.

- The scatter plots below show the distribution and the four clusters of cryptocurrencies. Also. we can see the outliers.
